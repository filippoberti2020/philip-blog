As we continue to rely heavily on digital communication, the energy consumption required to store and maintain our old emails may seem insignificant. However, new research shows that the impact of our email storage habits on climate change and natural resources is not to be underestimated. With the average person receiving and sending hundreds of emails per day, the energy required to keep all old emails can be limited only by our behavior. It's time to take a closer look at our digital footprint and make conscious decisions to reduce our energy consumption.


## Brief History

To understand the importance of managing our email communications, it's important to look back at the history of message dissemination, starting with the Roman Empire. The Romans had a state mail service that was essential for war and administration communications, highlighting the importance of efficient communication systems in society.

Fast forward to the present day, and email has become a staple in our daily lives, with almost all public and private services requiring some form of contact for communication or management purposes. While it may be difficult to completely avoid having an email address, we can still try to limit our impact through simple actions.

## Why it's important to keep a clean and limited inbox

The reason is simple: the more emails we have in our inbox, the more storage devices (such as hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and hybrid disk drives (HDDs)) are needed to store them, which in turn uses more energy and resources. The trend of newsletters also contributes to this issue, leading to an even greater use of energy to send and store communications.

Additionally, keeping a clean inbox can also benefit our own well-being. A clean inbox means less distractions and stress, allowing for a more focused and relaxed work life.

## How to clean and adapt a minimal inbox approach

1. Unsubscribe from all newsletters that you do not read or do not remember signing up for.
- To unsubscribe from newsletters, one of the best methods is to go to the end of the email page and look for a clickable text/link (usually in small font) that will allow you to unsubscribe.
- If your email management service allows it (such as Gmail), you should have the ability to unsubscribe via the three dots in the settings in the upper right-hand corner once you enter the newsletter email of which you wish to unsubscribe.

2. Delete all old emails

- If you have no documents or emails with material you need, then delete all the emails by selecting them all at once.
- If you want to be more aware of how much unnecessary data you're keeping, you can delete emails one by one, check them, and keep the ones you need.

NOTE:I do not recommend using any service to delete or carry out unsubscriptions because they require access to your e-mail to work. And as much as they may state in the terms of the services that they do not save your data I prefer not to give them the benefit of the doubt.
After following the steps shown above, you should have an empty or nearly empty inbox. And by unsubscribing from newsletters and deleting old emails, you'll be able to check for any missed emails or newsletters the next day.


## Apply this approach to all your digital data

This approach can be applied to almost any field concerning your digital data. You can start using this method for managing your photos, documents, and text/multimedia messages. By reducing the amount of digital data we keep, we can reduce our digital footprint and help protect the environment.
