#### Guide Steps

1. Find out the chip model of your 3D printer.
2. Download the right firmware version based on your 3D printer model.
3. Install it.

## Find out the chip model of your 3D printer

So you can find yourself in one of these following cases: 

* You have a **sticker** in front of the 3D printer with the model name (**H2** or **N32**).  
    > If you are in this situation, you can go to the second part of the guide with the model you just read in mind.
* You don't have a sticker.
    > If this is the case, this means that you have a **G32** chip board.

NOTE:
- It may happen that your motherboard has been replaced in case you bought the printer used or if it is a returned printer. So if you want to be 100% sure you need to read the text on the black motherboard chip. You should find something like "GD32F103", in this case you have a G32 chip model (You need to read the first part G[D]32).

## Download the right firmware version based on your 3D printer model

Now that you know what chip model you have, you need to download the printer and display firmware based on your 3D
